# README File - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

First of all, many thanks for evaluating my course project. Please have a look at my repository for this project as follows :-

https://github.com/masroorrizvi/getting-cleaning-data

This repository has 3 files in it namely :-

- run_analysis.R
- README.md (This file)
- CodeBook.md


As mentioned in the starting instructions,please find below the instructions to run the run_analysis.R file

First time around, run the script to see the tidy data at the console. Once satisfied, I suggest you to comment the tidy data command (line 307 of the script) and uncomment write and read commands (line 310 and 313) and run the script again. This will enable you to write the tidy data at the location specified and read it back to validate if the write and read process happen properly.

Please see the newly read data at the console to make sure that it looks alright. The data should show 180 rows and 70 columns.
